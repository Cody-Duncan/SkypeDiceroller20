Version 2.0.1
- Propogated the chat message information to the command window to improve user feedback.
- Rebuilt with Skype4COM.dll registered. Hopefully fixes an initialization error.
- Added "Failed to create Skype instance!" message when intialization fails.
- Tested with skype v5.3.0.120

Version 2.0.2
- determined that the message "Cannot create instance of Skype" is caused by not registering
the Skype4COM.dll . Included instructions in readme on how to register it.
- Fixed a bug where the CoUnitialize() and the end of main() would both call the DiceRoller
destructor, which clears the rolledVals vector twice, throwing an error.
-Upgraded Solution to Visual Studio 2010

December 31st, 2011
- Added RegisterSkype4COM.bat to make registering the dll a double-click process (for the users).
- Updated the readme to reflect the change, so that users can register the dll on thier own.
- Removed "Failed to create Skype instance!" message, apparently?

- Changed it so that the commands are case-insensitive. You can now write //difficulty
- Added some simpler versions of commands, //diff, //tdiff.
- Added command //remove:(t/f), that adds the choice that 1's remove one success.
